They said support was discontinued, but it suddenly got updated, and an option (Screen Reader Mode) was suddenly removed. Now it has themes, TAB is always on, and my text is off-center.
Why couldn't they just leave it the hell alone?? Now I have to redo all my text files! 1000+ text files!
I think I'll start looking for a better app before they decide to change it all again.
